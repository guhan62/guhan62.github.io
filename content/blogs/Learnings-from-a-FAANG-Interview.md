## FAANG Interview
I **failed** my 1st FAANG Interview. It's not like I have passed every other Interview I faced. Post my Bachelor's I was filtered from the 1st round in many companies and post my Master's companies are not ready to give me a chance (Not a complain, my profile does not fall in their radar). But I had assessed myself in my FAANG Interview and I was utterly disappointed with myself.

## Tips for the Interview
*  :facepunch: FAANG companies love hearing about your __past projects in a systematic way__, and they honor answers that abide with that code. It's good you run mocks with your friends or colleagues to get a good feel before your interview.  
*Interviewers, wants to get a feeling of how well you present and the way you indulge in depth. Take few moments, think before you speak*

*  :neutral_face: __Clarify your doubts as quick as possible__, trivial things in your code can be mentioned to the interviewer.  
*Pain for C++, is splitting Strings - I spent a good chunk of 6 mins splitting strings naively. I have a policy of choosing Java|Python for LC(LeetCode) for String Questions, but during the interview I felt very nervous.*

*  :no_mouth: Have a conversation with your interviewer during your Coding Rounds. I spent major time coding silently and thinking forgetting the presence of a soul. During your LeetCode practice time yourself and code.    
*Again Practice, with yourself while solving questions and time yourself*

* :monkey: Interviewers reserve time for Questions. Never ask weird Questions!  
*Please never ask weird question like Market Domination or Competitior Comparison*

* :astonished: Check your comms throughly. Mic, Audio, Camera & Lighting.  
*My Interviewers struggled to hear me, look at me - Checks were good, but the interviewer had to keep his ears close to the screen to listen to me.*

*  :pray: **It's your one Golden Ticket. Don't screw it up!**  
*Friends & Colleagues support you no matter what, work with them having mocks - Utilize available time to the maximum - Think before you speak*

#### All tips are usual, but etching them here - ensures that I will never repeat these mistakes

All The best for your Interview. I felt prepared, but I was scared since the time I got confirmed for the interview, as it was a higher level position I wrapped my head with a blanket that I would never get it! Be positive & Bold - Trust in yourself!
